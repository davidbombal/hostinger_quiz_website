            "question": "What is the difference between a hub and a switch?",
            "option_a": "A. A hub broadcasts all traffic to all ports, while a switch only sends traffic to the port that the destination device is connected to.",
            "option_b": "B. A hub is a physical device, while a switch is a logical device.",
            "option_c": "C. A hub is more expensive than a switch.",

            "option_b": "B. A static IP address cannot be changed, while a dynamic IP address can be changed.",
            "option_c": "C. A static IP address is more secure than a dynamic IP address.",
            "option_d": "D. A dynamic IP address is more efficient than a static IP address.",
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "A static IP address is assigned by a network administrator and remains the same for the life of the device. A dynamic IP address is assigned by a DHCP server and can change each time the device connects to the network."

            "option_d": "D. To store data.",
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "A DNS server is a server that translates domain names into IP addresses. This allows users to access websites by typing in a domain name, such as www.google.com, instead of having to remember the IP address, such as 172.217.14.192."

            "option_d": "D. To store data.",
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is used to divide a network into smaller networks. The subnet mask is used by routers to determine which packets should be forwarded to which networks."

            "option_a": "A. A broadcast address is sent to all hosts on a network, while a multicast address is sent to a group of hosts on a network.",
            "option_b": "B. A broadcast address is a single IP address, while a multicast address is a range of IP addresses.",
            "option_c": "C. A broadcast address cannot be used as a host address, while a multicast address can be used as a host address.",
            "option_d": "D. A broadcast address is used to send data to all hosts on a network, while a multicast address is used to send data to a group of hosts on a network.",

            "question": "What is the difference between a layer 2 and a layer 3 switch?",
            "option_a": "A. A layer 2 switch uses MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions, while a layer 3 switch uses IP addresses to make forwarding decisions.",
            "option_b": "B. A layer 2 switch can only forward traffic within a VLAN, while a layer 3 switch can forward traffic between VLANs.",
            "option_c": "C. A layer 2 switch is less expensive than a layer 3 switch.",
            "option_d": "D. A layer 2 switch is faster than a layer 3 switch.",
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "A layer 2 switch uses MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions, while a layer 3 switch uses IP addresses to make forwarding decisions. This means that a layer 2 switch can only forward traffic within a VLAN, while a layer 3 switch can forward traffic between VLANs."
