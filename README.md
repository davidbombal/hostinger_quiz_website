# Hostinger Quiz Website and GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT APIs.
## This is a proof of concept and could be improved on in a lot of ways.

1. To run this code use `git clone https://github.com/davidbombal/hostinger_quiz_website`
2. You need to have Python installed. The PDF document in the YouTube video description goes into detail on how to use the API. Please refer to that. Please take note GPT-4 API is now available and uses the chat completions API like the ChatGPT API does. It does not use the completions API like DaVinci-003 and other GPT-3 API models.
3. Ensure you have pip installed as well. You can use the command `sudo apt install python3-pip` on Debian Linux distros.
4. You need to install the following modules `pip install openai`
5. You need to get your own API Key, follow the PDF document in the YouTube video description to get you OpenAI API Key.
6. The `davinci-003.py` and `chatgpt-api.py` files contains the OpenAI API usage examples to create quiz questions in JSON format.
7. You can set up a server on Hostinger (https://www.hostinger.com/davidbombal.com. Use Coupon Code: DAVIDBOMBAL on checkout to get a 10% discount.) or you can run your web site locally using live server plugin. You only need to copy all the files excluding the .py files to the directory on your server. Follow the instructions in the video to get the website up and running on Hostinger or Live Server (on your local machine).
